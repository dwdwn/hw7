This card is typically used in servers that need multiple network interfaces, but why would someone need so many network interfaces in the first place?

In my case, I just wanted to explore the unknown, and see how many interfaces I could get working on my Pi, with full gigabit speed on each one.

But some people might want to use the Pi as a router, maybe using the popular OpenWRT or pfSense software, and having multiple fast interfaces is essential to building a custom router.

Other people might want multiple interfaces for network segregation, for redundancy, or to have multiple IP addresses for traffic routing and metering.

Whatever the case, none of that is important if the card doesn't even work! So let's plug it in.

Getting Drivers
My first attempt to get a driver was to clone the Raspberry Pi Linux source, and check with make menuconfig to search for any Intel networking drivers in the Linux source tree. I didn't find any, though, so I turned to the next idea, searching on Intel's website for some drivers.

The first page I came to was the Intel Ethernet Adapter Complete Driver Pack, which looked promising. But I noticed it was over 600 MB, was listed as 'OS Independent', and after I looked at what was in the driver pack, it looked like half of Intel's chips over the years were supported.

I just wanted to get the I340 working, and I really didn't care about all the Windows drivers and executables, so I kept searching.

Eventually I landed on the Linux Base Driver for Intel Gigabit Ethernet Network Connections page, and this page looked a lot more targeted towards Linux and a smaller set of devices.
